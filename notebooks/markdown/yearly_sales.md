- Search for a sire and select
- Clear selections with CTRL+"click" or CMD+"click" on each sires name or by deleting the typed entry

This is a little cumbersome to use, but was easiest to make quickly. You can exclude sales prices in the 95th percentile or higher using the "Excluding..." option in the Data filter. I would select "Excluding..." when looking at all data unless you specifically want to see some of the high priced outliers, otherwise the visual is compressed and uninterpretable.

The "Full" option will be more useful when looking at individual sires. 

**Notes:**
- When you highlight each box within each year you'll see a bunch of values.
    - upper_fence/lower_fence: These basically mark the start of where true outliers begin. They fluctuate based on the data but it's safe to assume they sit somewhere around the 10th and 90th percentiles.
    - q3: 75th percentile
    - median: 50th percentile
    - q1: 25th percentile
