This visual tells is meant to tell us how the relationship between gini (sales price volatility) and median price evolve over time. A positive correlation tells us that when gini goes up (i.e. volatility increases) then median price also goes up, so the two move in the same direction. Normally I would expect this relationship to be negative because more volatility would equate to a less desireable sire, and a less desireable sire would lead to lower sales prices.

What's interesting is that the correlation is positive for sires in their second year. So a 2nd year crop tends to see **higher volatility present at the same time as higher prices** - i.e. buyers are taking big-time shots on horses and presumably gambling on a sire's first crop performing well as 2yo's. I would assume a sire's second crop is a highly active (and potentially highly profitable) time for good pinhookers hoping to flip at the spring breeze sales, but I would need data to back that up. 

**Notes:**
1. Filter by foals >= 10 at minimum, otherwise the small sample sires distort the picture.
2. Changing years active won't change the underlying correlations - I probably could have deleted it. 
3. Correlation statistics are inherently volatile themselves, so like the two outputs above I wouldn't interpret these too literally (yet).
